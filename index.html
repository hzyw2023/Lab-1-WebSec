      <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What is OWASP, and why is it important?</strong><br>
        The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to enhance the
        security of software. The OWASP Foundation was established on December 1, 2001, and became a registered
        non-profit charity in the United States on April 21, 2004.</p>

      <p>The project gains its credibility as an impartial authority by being independent to any specific vendor. With
        a global network of chapters, it fosters the sharing of security expertise and the adoption of its standards
        to improve organizations security posture.</p>

      <p>Web applications are now essential to business operations, such as communication and commerce, which makes
        OWASP become significantly important. With increasing complexity in applications comes heightened
        vulnerability risks. OWASP aims to improve software security through community-driven projects and free tools.
        This creates a significant impact in assisting organizations to improve their web applications.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What is the OWASP Top 10, and how does it help organizations?</strong><br>
        The OWASP Top 10 is a globally recognized standard awareness document for developers and web application
        security. It reflects a general consensus regarding the most impacting security threats to web apps. In
        addition to listing critical vulnerabilities and threats, it also describes the ramifications of
        vulnerabilities how attackers take advantage of them and how organizations and developers can reduce the
        risks. This makes it both a learning tool and a practical framework to help organizations address security
        issues throughout the software development lifecycle.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-blue-700">How often is the OWASP Top 10 updated, and why?</strong><br>
        It is updated every few years with the current list being released in 2021 and an update expected in 2025.
        Since its initial publication in 2003, it undergoes regular updates to stay aligned with the ever-changing
        threat landscape, especially emergent of new technologies such as large language model (LLM).</p>

          <p><strong class="text-blue-700">Risk Description:</strong><br>
            Injection attacks occur when user-supplied input or untrusted data is sent to an interpreter (eg., SQL, NOSQL, OS command, ORM, LDAP, EL). If this data is improperly validated or sanitized, allowing malicious data to be
            interpreted as commands or queries by an interpreter which leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or system compromise.</p>
          
          <p><strong class="text-blue-700">Injection flaws can affect various technologies, such as:</strong>
            <br>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>SQL/NoSQL database</li>
              <li>Operating System (OS) commands</li>
              <li>LDAP queries (bypass authentication)</li>
              <li>Object Relational Mapping (ORM)</li>
              <li>Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) </li>
            </ul></p>
  
  
        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">How It Happens:</strong><br>Injection vulnerabilities typically arise due to poor input validation and unsafe concatenation of user input into system commands or queries.</p>

      <img src="British-airways-data-breach.jpeg" alt="British Airways data breach image"
        class="w-full h-auto object-cover bg-gray-300 rounded mb-6" />

      <div class="space-y-4 text-justify">
        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What happened?</strong><br>
          British Airways suffered a massive data breach that affected approximately 500,000 customers in year 2018. The attackers managed to intercept customer data including full names, email addresses, credit card information especially the Card Verification Value (CVV), and the booking details. The attackers injected malicious code into British Airways' website and mobile app to conduct the breach. This code skimmed data from customers whenever they entered it into forms. The compromised script was loaded from the Modernizr JavaScript library that was tampered by the attackers.</p>

        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">Connection to OWASP Risk:</strong><br>
          The breach relates to some OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:<br>
        1) Security Misconfiguration - British Airways failed to protect third-party scripts properly and failed to enforce security policies as per Content Security Policy (CSP).<br>
        2) Injection(JavaScript Injection/Cross-Site Scripting) - The attackers inject malicious JavaScript into the site successfully, leading to the data breach.<br>
        3) Insufficient Logging & Monitoring - The breach went undetected for over two weeks because of the lack of effective monitoring routines.</p>

        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What could have prevented it?</strong><br>
          British Airways cound have prevented or mitigated the breach through: <br>
        1) Content Security Policy(CSP) - The execution of unauthorized scripts would have restricted by a strong CSP to prevent malicious code injection.<br>
        2) Regular Security Audits and Monitoring - Constant monitoring and anomaly detection could have detected suspicious changes of unusual data flows to alert and respond to the emergencies.<br>
        3) Third-Party Script Management - Reducing reliance on third-party scripts or sandboxing could limit the attack vectors to the system.</p>
