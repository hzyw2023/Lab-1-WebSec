      <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What is OWASP, and why is it important?</strong><br>
        The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to enhance the
        security of software. The OWASP Foundation was established on December 1, 2001, and became a registered
        non-profit charity in the United States on April 21, 2004.</p>

      <p>The project gains its credibility as an impartial authority by being independent to any specific vendor. With
        a global network of chapters, it fosters the sharing of security expertise and the adoption of its standards
        to improve organizations security posture.</p>

      <p>Web applications are now essential to business operations, such as communication and commerce, which makes
        OWASP become significantly important. With increasing complexity in applications comes heightened
        vulnerability risks. OWASP aims to improve software security through community-driven projects and free tools.
        This creates a significant impact in assisting organizations to improve their web applications.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What is the OWASP Top 10, and how does it help organizations?</strong><br>
        The OWASP Top 10 is a globally recognized standard awareness document for developers and web application
        security. It reflects a general consensus regarding the most impacting security threats to web apps. In
        addition to listing critical vulnerabilities and threats, it also describes the ramifications of
        vulnerabilities how attackers take advantage of them and how organizations and developers can reduce the
        risks. This makes it both a learning tool and a practical framework to help organizations address security
        issues throughout the software development lifecycle.</p>

      <p><strong class="text-blue-700">How often is the OWASP Top 10 updated, and why?</strong><br>
        It is updated every few years with the current list being released in 2021 and an update expected in 2025.
        Since its initial publication in 2003, it undergoes regular updates to stay aligned with the ever-changing
        threat landscape, especially emergent of new technologies such as large language model (LLM).</p>

      <div class="space-y-4 text-justify">
        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">Risk Description:</strong><br>
          Injection attacks occur when user-supplied input is improperly handled, allowing malicious data to be
          interpreted as commands or queries by an interpreter (e.g., SQL, OS, LDAP).</p>

        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">How It Happens:</strong><br>
          Attackers exploit input fields (like forms or URLs) by injecting malicious code that executes unauthorized
          commands or retrieves sensitive data.</p>

        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">Prevention:</strong></p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>Use parameterized queries and prepared statements</li>
          <li>Validate and sanitize user input</li>
          <li>Use least privilege access for databases</li>
          <li>Apply security headers and proper error handling</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-4">Case Study: British Airways Data Breach (2018)</h2>

      <img src="British-airways-data-breach.jpeg" alt="British Airways data breach image"
        class="w-full h-auto object-cover bg-gray-300 rounded mb-6" />

      <div class="space-y-4 text-justify">
        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What happened?</strong><br>
          Attackers injected malicious JavaScript into the British Airways website and mobile app, capturing personal
          and payment information from about 380,000 customers.</p>

        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">Connection to OWASP Risk:</strong><br>
          This was a classic injection attack via third-party script tampering (supply chain weakness) that captured
          sensitive user data.</p>

        <p><strong class="text-blue-700">What could have prevented it?</strong><br>
          A strong Content Security Policy (CSP), subresource integrity checks, and better input/output monitoring could
          have stopped or minimized the impact.</p>
